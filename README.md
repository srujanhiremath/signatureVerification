# 🖋️ Signature Verification using Structural Similarity Index (SSIM)

This project compares two signature images to determine if the second one is **genuine** or **forged**, using the **Structural Similarity Index (SSIM)** technique from `scikit-image`.

---

## 📌 Features

- Compares two signatures for authenticity  
- Converts images to grayscale for comparison  
- Resizes them to ensure proper alignment  
- Uses SSIM for pixel-wise similarity scoring  
- Determines if the signature is **verified** or **forged**

---

## 🧾 Example Output

```bash
Similarity score: 0.89  
Result: Original and Verified
````

├── signatureVerification.py    # Main Python script
├── sign1.jpeg                  # Original signature image
├── sign4.jpeg                  # Signature to verify
├── README.md                   # Project documentation
```

## ⚙️ Requirements

Install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install opencv-python scikit-image numpy
```

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Place Images**
   Add your two signature images in the same folder:

   * `sign1.jpeg` → the original signature
   * `sign4.jpeg` → the signature to verify

2. **Run the script**
   Execute the script using Python:

   ```bash
   python signatureVerification.py
   ```

3. **View Result**
   The terminal will show the similarity score and verdict.

---

## 🔍 How It Works

* **Step 1:** Reads both images using OpenCV.
* **Step 2:** Converts them to grayscale.
* **Step 3:** Resizes both to the same dimensions.
* **Step 4:** Calculates SSIM score between the images.
* **Step 5:** Compares the score against a threshold (default: `0.75`).
* **Step 6:** Prints result as `Original and Verified` or `Forged`.

---

## ⚡ Configuration

You can adjust the sensitivity by changing the threshold in `signatureVerification.py`:

```python
THRESHOLD = 0.75
```

Increase the threshold for stricter matching, or decrease it for more lenient checks.

---

## 🧠 Potential Improvements

* Add GUI for user-friendly signature upload
* Integrate machine learning models for higher accuracy
* Build a web API for signature verification services
* Batch processing of multiple signatures
